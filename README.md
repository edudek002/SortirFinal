#SORTIR

An app that allows users to enter a city, date and interest category then searches nearby events based on the information entered.

A list of 10 events will display in a table and on the GoogleMaps display.

The user will select one of the events via click causing the Lyft button to display the estimated fare to get to the event as well as the time until a car can arrive to take the user to the event location.
